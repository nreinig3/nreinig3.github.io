# Data Scientist

### Education
Computational Analytics, MS (Georgia Tech)

### Work Experience
#### Data Specialist @ IHME
- Led large-scale quality control for global disease estimates by developing automated static dashboards (Python/R, Matplotlib/ggplot2) to track and visualize data inconsistencies in key metrics across 195+ countries (1990–present), enabling continuous model calibration and reducing errors in final outputs
- Extracted and analyzed data for a Long COVID study, adapting methodologies to account for variations in diagnostic criteria and sample population characteristics, often working with less-documented, non-published datasets. Initiated contact and coordinated with external researchers to secure raw data, ensuring alignment with study objectives
- Contributed to 9 high-impact scientific literature publications, including analyses for the influential "Global Burden of Disease Study” (The Lancet, 2019), with a combined total of over 10,000 citations

#### Data Analyst @ IHME
- Extracted and cleaned disease burden data from 100+ studies for meta-analysis, supporting IHME’s modeling pipeline
- Automated R/Python scripts to generate publication-ready visualizations and custom calculations (e.g., age-standardized rates and multi-country regions) for four publications
- Trained and mentored 10+ junior analysts on data extraction, systematic review protocols, and IHME’s analytical pipelines via workshops and training videos
- Interviewed and evaluated 20+ candidates for data analyst roles, improving team hiring efficiency

### Projects
#### [Industrial Anomaly Detection Using Custom Transformer Architecture (Practicum project for MS degree)](https://github.com/nreinig3/anomaly-detection-project/blob/main/README.md).
- Developed a Transformer-based deep learning model from scratch to detect anomalies in industrial manufacturing processes for Novelis, a major metal manufacturer
- Achieved 95% detection accuracy for anomalous images by incorporating best practices from recent literature on computer vision and industrial IoT analytics
- Experimented with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for comparative analysis, optimizing model robustness.

#### LLM-Powered Job Matching & Concept Mapping Tool
- Helped to design a natural language processing (NLP) tool that ingests job search queries and leverages an LLM model (Doc2Vec and Big Query ML) to match them with relevant job postings
- Created a knowledge graph-style concept map using JavaScript and D3 to visually summarize top job matches, improving user interpretability. Tool was deployed using Flask for interactive user testing

#### NYC Real Estate Price Prediction Model
- Helped to develop a predictive modeling system using multilinear regression as part of a team effort to forecast real estate prices in New York City, by performing feature engineering and EDA on housing datasets to identify key pricing drivers (e.g., location, square footage, amenities)
- Achieved an R² score of 0.81 for our price model, while identifying potential problems with overfitting that may have contributed to difficulties in accurate price forecasting
